# Animal-detection
## Overview
This project showcases a deep learning-powered image classification model capable of identifying 15 distinct animal species from images. Leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and the strength of transfer learning, the model learns to recognize each animal based on its unique visual patterns and textures.
It lays the groundwork for applications such as real-time wildlife monitoring, educational AI tools, and automated animal identification systems.

## Animal Classes
The model is trained to detect and classify the following animals:
Cat, Dog, Elephant, Horse, Lion, Tiger, Bear, Zebra, Deer, Monkey, Giraffe, Cow, Sheep, Chicken, Fox

## Dataset Details
Image Shape: 224x224x3 (RGB)
Dataset Format: Organized in ImageNet-style directory structure:
